# AliBot
 
AliBot is a personal Discord bot, it can send gifs and play music.

## Usage

This isn't intended for others to use, but if you want to, you'll have to change the name of .example.env to .env and set all the variables within. As a precursor to that, you'll have to set up a MySQL database and a Lavalink node, or at least get access to those, among other things.

## Acknowledgements

Much of this code was heavily based on the discord.py example code as well as the open-source bots of [Rapptz](https://github.com/Rapptz/RoboDanny), [Umbra](https://github.com/AbstractUmbra/Mipha), and 
[Pythonista](https://github.com/PythonistaGuild/Pythonista-Bot/).

Shoutout to [Thanos](https://github.com/Sachaa-Thanasius/Beira) for making this possible by inspiring me with his own bot development, as well as Matt for entertaining my bot on their server.
