It's a show stoppin' number
A real showstopper
A show stoppin' number, come on
Something to shock 'em
To bring them a-crawling
A big-time box office draw
With the press and the glamor, we'll kill the reviews
Spotlight on Mr. Ingénue
So fill up your tumbler
Got a show stoppin' number for you
A show stoppin' number
Is something you die for
A real catchy, earwormy tune
An award-winning score
That seeps in and out of your pores
A ditty to make the chorus girls swoon
It'll unify humanity in a thundering chorus
No exits from this Broadway venue
So splash those shiny cymbals
Got a show stoppin' hymnal for you
You left me out of your sight for one second And look what happens, nightmare time
It's worse than you could imagine
Not sex and not drugs
Just alien invading minds
No more family vacays together
Cause your only daughter's under the weather
And if you actually paid attention to me
You'd see, I'm not your seed
I'm not your angsty teen
No matter what you believe
The apple's fallen far from the tree
It's not my fault anymore
No more curfews to be late for
No more being worried and waiting by the door
Sorry to interrupt\nBut we got bones to pluck
The time for chaos is long past overdue
Death isn't optional\nIn fact it’s optimal
Your time is up
And now we go through you
It starts with not questioning the answers
And giving up before you've begun
It locks all the doors, increases the pressure
And in a flash
Your time is up before it's done
Who cares about normal?
I'll never conform
I will be content to resent the status quo
Hufflepuffs are particularly good finders
What the hell is a Hufflepuff
